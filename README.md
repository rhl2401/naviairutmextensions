This extension serves the purpose of making the installation of a new PC easy. The UTM department use a lot of different extensions in VS Code and it might get tedious to serach for and install them one by one. 

This extension does all of the boring tasks for you.

## Step by step
1. Download the latest file named *.vsix
2. Install the extension by selecting "Install from VSIX..." in VS Code like in the picture below:
